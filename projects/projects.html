                        Before I wrote this the lab had to manually calculate and graph data from an excel file that contained over 3000 lines per experiment!</li>

                        <li class = "description">This project was also a simple workplace automation tool. I used regular expressions to match the name of surgical types
                        so that we could filter out surgeries that would not qualify for our study. Before this, somebody had to manually dig through an excel file.</li>

                    Given data, the model can predict how well players will do based upon their previous stats and data.</li>

                    This is a passion project that Fredrick has wanted to do since the early days of his computer programming obsession. Fredrick loves sports management sims and has always wanted to play a good college football one!</li>
